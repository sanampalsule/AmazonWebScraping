##Aim of the Project:
The main objective of this project is to develop a data extraction pipeline that scrapes product price data from Amazon pages and utilizes the collected data to train a machine learning model for predicting future prices. The project aims to demonstrate the application of web scraping techniques, data manipulation, and time-series forecasting using the XGBoost algorithm.



##Technical Components:
- Python programming language
- BeautifulSoup library for web scraping
- Requests library for sending HTTP requests
- Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
- XGBoost library for time-series forecasting
- CSV module for reading and writing CSV files
- Datetime module for handling dates and times

This project showcases the application of web scraping techniques to collect product price data from Amazon pages, and utilizes the scraped data to train an XGBoost model for time-series forecasting. The implemented data extraction pipeline automates the process of data collection, while the trained model provides accurate 7-day ahead price predictions. The project demonstrates the integration of various technical components, including web scraping, data manipulation, machine learning, and time-series forecasting, to achieve the desired outcome of predicting future product prices based on historical data.
